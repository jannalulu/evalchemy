Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling what it means for one number to divide another in a different base. \n\nFirst, I need to convert both numbers from base b to base 10, right? Because I can't really do division in different bases. So, let's start with 17_b. In base b, the number 17 represents 1 times b to the power of 1 plus 7 times b to the power of 0. So, that's 1*b + 7. \n\nSimilarly, 97_b is 9 times b to the power of 1 plus 7 times b to the power of 0. So, that's 9b + 7. \n\nNow, the problem says that 17_b divides 97_b. In other words, when I divide 97_b by 17_b, I should get an integer with no remainder. So, mathematically, I can write this as:\n\n97_b / 17_b = integer\n\nBut since I converted both numbers to base 10, I can write this as:\n\n(9b + 7) / (b + 17) = integer\n\nSo, I need to find all integer values of b greater than 9 such that (9b + 7) divided by (b + 17) is an integer. \n\nHmm, okay. So, I need to find integer values of b such that (9b + 7) divided by (b + 17) is an integer. Let me think about how to approach this. \n\nOne way to approach this is to perform polynomial division or use the remainder theorem. Let me try polynomial division first. \n\nSo, let's divide 9b + 7 by b + 17. \n\nFirst, I need to see how many times b + 17 goes into 9b + 7. Well, b goes into 9b nine times, right? So, I can write:\n\n9b + 7 = 9*(b + 17) + (9*17 - 7)\n\nLet me check that. 9*(b + 17) is 9b + 153, and 9*17 is 15</think>\n\n### :white_check_mark: Final Answer:\n\nThe integer bases greater than 9 for which 17_b divides 97_b are \\boxed{18}, \\boxed{20}, \\boxed{22}, \\boxed{24}, \\boxed{26}, \\boxed{28}, \\boxed{30}, \\boxed{32}, \\boxed{34}, \\boxed{36}, \\boxed{38}, \\boxed{40}, \\boxed{42}, \\boxed{44}, \\boxed{46}, \\boxed{48}, \\boxed{50}, \\boxed{52}, \\"
