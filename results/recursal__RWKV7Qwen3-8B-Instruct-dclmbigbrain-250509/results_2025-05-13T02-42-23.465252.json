            "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find all integer bases b > 9 such that 17_b divides 97_b. Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling what it means for one number to divide another in a different base. \n\nFirst, I need to convert both numbers from base b to base 10, right? Because then I can work with them in a more familiar number system. Let me recall how base conversion works. \n\nIn base b, the number 17_b would be equal to 1*b^1 + 7*b^0. Similarly, 97_b would be 9*b^1 + 7*b^0. So, converting both numbers to base 10, we have:\n\n17_b = 1*b + 7 = b + 7\n\n97_b = 9*b + 7\n\nSo, the problem is asking for all integers b > 9 such that (97_b) is divisible by (17_b). In other words, (97_b) divided by (17_b) should result in an integer. \n\nSo, mathematically, we can write this as:\n\n(97_b) / (17_b) = (9b + 7) / (b + 7) must be an integer.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding all integers b > 9 such that (9b + 7) is divisible by (b + 7). \n\nLet me write that as:\n\n(9b + 7) / (b + 7) is an integer.\n\nNow, I need to find all integers b > 9 such that this fraction is an integer. \n\nTo solve this, I can perform polynomial division or use algebraic manipulation to simplify the expression. Let me try polynomial division. \n\nDivide 9b + 7 by b + 7. \n\nLet me write it out:\n\nDivide 9b + 7 by b + 7. \n\nFirst term: 9b divided by b is 9. Multiply (b + 7) by 9: 9b + 63. Subtract that from 9b + 7:\n\n(9b + 7) - (9b + 63) = 9b + 7 - 9b - 63 = -56. \n\nSo, the division gives 9 with a remainder of -56. Therefore, we can</think>\n\n### :white_check_mark: Final Answer:\n\n\\boxed{10}\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Convert Bases to Integers:**\n   - $17_b = b + 7$\n   - $97_b = 9b + 7$\n\n2. **Set Up the Division:**\n   - We need"
