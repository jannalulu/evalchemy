            "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find all integer bases b > 9 such that 17_b divides 97_b. Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling what it means for one number to divide another in a different base. \n\nFirst, I need to convert both numbers from base b to base 10, right? Because then I can work with them in a more familiar number system. Let me recall how base conversion works. \n\nIn base b, the number 17_b would be equal to 1*b^1 + 7*b^0. Similarly, 97_b would be 9*b^1 + 7*b^0. So, converting both numbers to base 10, we have:\n\n17_b = 1*b + 7 = b + 7\n\n97_b = 9*b + 7\n\nSo, the problem is asking for all integers b > 9 such that (97_b) is divisible by (17_b). In other words, (97_b) divided by (17_b) should result in an integer. \n\nSo, mathematically, we can write this as:\n\n(97_b) / (17_b) = (9b + 7) / (b + 7) must be an integer.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding all integers b > 9 such that (9b + 7) is divisible by (b + 7). \n\nLet me write that as:\n\n(9b + 7) / (b + 7) is an integer.\n\nNow, I need to find all integers b > 9 such that this fraction is an integer. \n\nTo solve this, I can perform polynomial division or use algebraic manipulation to simplify the expression. Let me try polynomial division. \n\nDivide 9b + 7 by b + 7. \n\nLet me write it out:\n\nDivide 9b + 7 by b + 7. \n\nFirst term: 9b divided by b is 9. Multiply (b + 7) by 9: 9b + 63. Subtract that from 9b + 7:\n\n(9b + 7) - (9b + 63) = 9b + 7 - 9b - 63 = -56. \n\nSo, the division gives 9 with a remainder of -56. Therefore, we can write:\n\n(9b + 7) / (b + 7) = 9 - 56/(b + 7)\n\nTherefore, for this to be an integer, the remainder must be zero. So, -56/(b + 7) must be an integer. Which implies that (b + 7) divides -56. \n\nBut since b + 7 is a positive integer (since b > 9, so b + 7 > 16), we can say that (b + 7) divides 56. \n\nWait, but since b + 7 divides -56, and since b + 7 is positive, then b + 7 must divide 56. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding all integers b > 9 such that b + 7 is a positive divisor of 56. \n\nSo, first, let me find all positive divisors of 56. \n\nThe prime factorization of 56 is 2^3 * 7^1. Therefore, the positive divisors are:\n\n1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56.\n\nBut since b + 7 must be a positive divisor of 56, and b > 9, then b + 7 must be one of the divisors of 56 that is greater than or equal to 10 (since b > 9 implies b + 7 > 10). \n\nWait, let me check. If b > 9, then b + 7 > 9 + 7 = 16. So, the divisors of 56 that are greater than 16. \n\nLet me list the divisors of 56 again:\n\n1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56.\n\nSo, which of these are greater than 16? Let's see:\n\n16 is the threshold. So divisors greater than 16 are 28, 56. \n\nWait, 14 is 14, which is less than 16. So, 14 is not greater than 16. So, the divisors of 56 that are greater than 16 are 28 and 56. \n\nTherefore, the possible values of b + 7 are 28 and</think>\n\n### :white_check_mark: Final Answer:\n\nThe integer bases $ b $ greater than 9 for which $ 97_b $ is divisible by $ b + 7 $ are $ \\boxed{28} $ and $ \\boxed{56} $.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe bases are \\boxed{28} and \\boxed{5"
